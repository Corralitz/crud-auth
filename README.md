# About the project
This project is a web app intended to manage containers for a Colombian company, so it is completely on spanish.
Basically you can add cointainers, that then are leased and sold (and after the lease ends, they are entered back into the shop), the actions are registered as commodatums. Apart from this you can add clients and items that the container should have (although this two last caabilities are barebones and appart from just adding the items (and changing stock number) and adding clients, you can't do much more with them.

The front end is made with React.js, the back end is made with Node.js and MongoDb (using mongoose).
